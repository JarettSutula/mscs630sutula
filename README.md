# mscs630sutula
A repository for MSCS-630L Security Algorithms &amp; Protocols

If you'd like to run the django web server and add a user yourself, follow this:

1. CD yourself into
```
/mscs630sutula/prj/writeup/code/aes_sutula
```

2. Run the following command to start up the django server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

3. Once the server is up and running, open your browser of choice and go to:
```
127.0.0.1:8000
```

4. You are now at the homepage of JSPM. Any accounts you make or credentials you add to them will be saved securely in a database, meaning you could spin up this server on a different machine and access your account as long as you remember your JSPM username and password.

Any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at sutula4@gmail.com.
